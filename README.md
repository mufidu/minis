Collections of the other things I write, mostly as practice. All codes are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu/others).

-   [Car.ly](https://mufidu.github.io/car.ly) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu/car.ly)

    My rebuild of [Natours](https://mufidu.github.io/natours), now implementing Flexbox, and without Lorem ipsum anymore. Still about a fiction company, tho. Abandoned as I prefer to do other real stuffs.

-   [Notes](https://notes.mufidu.com) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mufidu/note)

    My personal public notes publisher. I write everything mostly on Obisidian, and sometimes I want to share it with someone. But, I don't have [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish), so I implement it myself. Still have to manually add all notes and images, tho.
